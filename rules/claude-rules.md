## How to Use Search Syntax
To search for tweets, you can use natural language commands or specific Twitter syntax. Examples:

**Natural language:**
- "Search for tweets by elonmusk about bitcoin"
- "Find tweets mentioning Claude with at least 100 likes"
- "Show tweets with videos about artificial intelligence in the last month"

**Direct syntax:**
- `from:elonmusk bitcoin`
- `@anthropic min_faves:100`
- `AI filter:native_video since:2023-12-01`

## Main Operators

### Users
- `from:username` - Tweets sent by a specific account
- `to:username` - Replies to a specific account
- `@username` - Tweets mentioning the account

### Media and Links
- `filter:media` - Tweets with any media
- `filter:images` - Tweets with images
- `filter:native_video` - Tweets with videos
- `filter:links` - Tweets with links

### Dates
- `since:YYYY-MM-DD` - Tweets after this date
- `until:YYYY-MM-DD` - Tweets before this date

### Engagement
- `min_retweets:n` - Tweets with at least n retweets
- `min_faves:n` - Tweets with at least n likes
- `min_replies:n` - Tweets with at least n replies

## Practical Examples
1. **Search for tweets by a user on a topic:**
